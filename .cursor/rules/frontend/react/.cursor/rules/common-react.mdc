# React Naming Conventions {.guideline}
- Favor named exports for components.

# Component Design {.guideline}
- Avoid nested `if/else` or complex conditional rendering.
- Extract new components when logic becomes hard to follow.
- Use inline ternaries only for small, readable expressions.

# Timing Functions {.guideline}
- Use `setTimeout` only when necessary.
- Always add a comment to explain the reason for its use.

# Comments {.guideline}
- Avoid redundant or obvious comments.
- Only add comments for:
  - Race conditions (e.g. explaining async timing bugs).
  - Long-term TODOs.
  - Complex logic that even experienced engineers may misunderstand.
