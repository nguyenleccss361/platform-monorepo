Follow these rules when you write typescript code:
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use functions instead of const, for example, “function handleClick() {}”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
