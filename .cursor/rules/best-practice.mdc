# Coding conventions
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.

# Naming conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use descriptive variable with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError) and use descriptive function names.
